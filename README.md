🧬 Generative Imputation of Missing Multi-Omics Data (mRNA → CNV Reconstruction)
<p align="center"><b>Biomedical Multimodal Learning — University of Colorado Denver</b></p>
📖 Overview

This project investigates generative deep learning models for imputing missing omics data.
Using TCGA Pan-Cancer data, we focus on reconstructing genomic features (CNV) from transcriptomic profiles (mRNA).

The goal is to improve multi-omics completeness by:

Learning cross-modal biological relationships

Recovering missing CNV signals

Improving downstream tasks like cancer subtype classification
